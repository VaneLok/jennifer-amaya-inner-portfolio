                    I've always been a builder at heart. At first, that meant spaces and visuals, then it shifted into systems, networks, and everything behind the scenes. Cybersecurity clicked because it gave me a way to protect the things I care about building.

                    These certifications are part of that journey. Each one has opened new doors, from the basics of how networks operate to spotting vulnerabilities and tracing threats. I balance it all out with hands-on practice in my homelab, where I'm constantly testing, exploring, and learning by doing. That's where it all starts to make sense.

                    I spent Canada Day doing what I love most: tinkering. I set up my first pfSense router (FreeBSD-based) and dropped a fresh Debian server onto the network. It wasn't all smooth sailing, my Realtek RTL8125 NIC gave me some driver drama, but a little digging led me to a fix using a pkg install trick I found on Rebecca Peck's blog. Major shoutout to the community for that one. Setting up my own FreeBSD router from scratch was incredibly satisfying and reminded me why I love learning through building.

                    This was my official jump into the world of cybersecurity. I studied everything from risk management to incident response and walked away not just certified, but completely hooked. Think of this as the moment I stopped just being curious about security and started getting serious about it.

                    This was my crash course into the wild world of cyber threats and the tools used to fight them. I explored everything from malware to mitigation strategies, getting a solid grip on how real-world attacks unfold and how defenders push back. It was messy, fascinating, and exactly what I needed to keep going.

                    This was my starting point, the hands-on sandbox where I first explored networking, system fundamentals, and basic security concepts. It was the perfect launchpad, filled with "aha!" moments that made me realize just how much I love breaking things down to see how they tick (without actually breaking them, of course).

                    This one pulled me deep into the minds of threat actors. I learned how to trace attacks, analyze patterns, and turn raw data into actionable insights. It felt like solving a puzzle where every piece tells a story except the stakes are higher, and the clock is always ticking. Loved every minute of it.
